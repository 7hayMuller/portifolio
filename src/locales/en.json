The deeper I got into design, the more I realized how understanding otions, behaviors, and the small details can completely change the outcome of a product.<br/><br/>I love exploring the world and paying attention to things most people overlook — and I bring that same sensitivity into my work. It helps me build interfaces that aren’t just visually appealing, but clear, purposeful, and user-focused.",
